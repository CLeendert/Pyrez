## Contributing to Pyrez

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. It makes the library substantially better. :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. These are guidelines, not hard rules.

## This is too much to read! I want to ask a question!

Generally speaking questions are better suited in our resources below.

- [The FAQ in the documentation](https://luissilva1044894.github.io/Pyrez/faq)

### Git Commit Guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues or pull requests outside of the first line.
    - Please use the shorthand `#123` and not the full URL.

### Code Style Guide
The Pyrez codebase uses the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/ "PEP 8") code style.

In addition to the standards outlined in PEP 8, we have a few guidelines:
- Use 4 spaces for tabs, never tab characters.
- No trailing whitespace, blank lines should have no whitespace.
- Naming styles:
    - Always use the CapitalizedWords convention for Classes names.
    - Always use the mixedCase convention for Function, Method, and Variable names.
- Always use double-quoted strings (e.g. "#flatearth"), unless a double-quote occurs within the string.
